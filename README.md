# FormKitMultiStep

FormKitMultiStep is a Vue 3 component for creating schema-based multi-step forms with FormKit. It is based
off the discussion and examples described in [this](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/63) FormKit issue 
as well as a few others

It is experimental and rather opinionated at the moment, use at your own discretion.
